The printed circuit board was designed in pre-released KiCAD 5.99 available at [nightly build](https://kicad-downloads.s3.cern.ch/index.html?prefix=windows/nightly/).

The core of the board is IoT Bluetooth chip from Nordic Semi nRF52832 which drives Nixie tubes IN-12 statically via nine shift registers.
